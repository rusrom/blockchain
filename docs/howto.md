## cryptography
**cryptography** includes both high level recipes and low level interfaces to common cryptographic algorithms such as symmetric ciphers, message digests, and key derivation functions. For example, to encrypt something with cryptographyâ€™s high level symmetric encryption recipe:

```
>>> from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
>>> # Put this somewhere safe!
>>> key = Fernet.generate_key()
>>> f = Fernet(key)
>>> token = f.encrypt(b"A really secret message. Not for prying eyes.")
>>> token
b'...'
>>> f.decrypt(token)
b'A really secret message. Not for prying eyes.'
```

### Installation
You can install cryptography with pip:
