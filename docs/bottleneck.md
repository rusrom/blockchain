## Blockchain is a promising technology, but bottlenecks and complex challenges lie ahead

Blockchain is a tamper-resistant and time-stamped database (ledger) operating through a distributed network of multiple nodes or users.

As such, it can validate transactions and update records in a synchronised, transparent and decentralised way.

Blockchain is based on a particular combination of key features:
1. decentralisation,
2. tamper-resistance,
3. transparency, security and
4. smart contracts.

But it is still at an early or emerging stage. Depending on the type of blockchain, challenges can include:

1. scalability and performance,
2. interoperability,
3. integration with legacy systems,
4. high energy consumption, and the
5. protection of personal, sensitive and confidential data.
